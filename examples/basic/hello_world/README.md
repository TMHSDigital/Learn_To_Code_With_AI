# AI-Assisted Hello World Example

This example demonstrates how to use AI tools like Cursor to create a simple web application. The application is a modern take on the classic "Hello World" program, featuring:

- Interactive user input
- Dynamic greetings
- Modern UI design
- Responsive layout

## How It Was Built with AI

This example was created using Cursor's AI capabilities:

1. **HTML Structure**: 
   - Asked Cursor to "create a modern HTML structure for a greeting application"
   - AI suggested the basic container and input elements
   - Refined the structure with natural language commands

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Prompted "style the application with a modern gradient background and card layout"
   - AI generated the initial CSS
   - Iteratively improved the design through conversation

3. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - Requested "add functionality to greet the user with random greetings"
   - AI implemented the core greeting function
   - Enhanced with input validation and keyboard events

## Key Learning Points

- Using AI to scaffold basic project structure
- Iterative development with AI assistance
- Implementing modern design patterns
- Adding interactive features
- Error handling and input validation

## Running the Example

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
2. Enter a name in the input field
3. Click "Greet" or press Enter
4. Observe the random greeting message

## Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML structure
- `style.css`: Modern CSS styling
- `script.js`: Interactive functionality

## Next Steps

Try modifying the code using Cursor's AI features:
1. Add more greeting variations
2. Implement different color themes
3. Add animations to the greeting
4. Extend the functionality with new features

## Tips for AI-Assisted Coding

- Be specific in your requests to the AI
- Review and understand the generated code
- Use AI suggestions as a starting point
- Iterate and refine through conversation
