# AI-Assisted Todo Application

This intermediate example demonstrates how to use AI tools to build a modern, feature-rich todo application. The project showcases various programming concepts and modern web development practices.

## Features

- Add, complete, and delete todos
- Filter todos by status (all, active, completed)
- Dark mode support with theme persistence
- Local storage for data persistence
- Responsive design
- Modern animations and transitions
- Template-based DOM manipulation

## How It Was Built with AI

This example demonstrates several AI-assisted development techniques:

### 1. Structure Planning
- Used AI to design the application architecture
- Generated initial HTML structure with semantic markup
- Implemented template pattern for todo items

### 2. Styling Implementation
- Created modern CSS with CSS variables
- Implemented dark mode theming
- Added smooth transitions and animations
- Designed responsive layout

### 3. JavaScript Development
- Implemented class-based architecture
- Added local storage persistence
- Created event handling system
- Implemented filtering system

## Code Organization

### HTML (`index.html`)
- Semantic structure
- Template element for todo items
- Accessibility considerations
- Clean component hierarchy

### CSS (`style.css`)
- CSS variables for theming
- Modern flexbox layout
- Smooth animations
- Responsive design
- Dark mode support

### JavaScript (`script.js`)
- Class-based architecture
- Event delegation
- Local storage integration
- Template-based rendering

## Learning Points

1. **Modern JavaScript Features**
   - Class syntax
   - Template literals
   - Arrow functions
   - Local storage API
   - Event delegation

2. **CSS Techniques**
   - CSS variables
   - Flexbox layout
   - Transitions and animations
   - Dark mode implementation

3. **HTML Best Practices**
   - Semantic markup
   - Accessibility
   - Template elements
   - Modern attributes

4. **Programming Patterns**
   - MVC-like structure
   - Event delegation
   - State management
   - Template system

## AI Development Process

1. **Initial Planning**
   ```
   Prompt: "Design a modern todo app structure with these requirements:
   - Dark mode support
   - Local storage
   - Filtering capabilities"
   ```

2. **HTML Structure**
   ```
   Prompt: "Create a semantic HTML structure for a todo app with:
   - Input for new todos
   - List for todo items
   - Filter buttons
   - Theme toggle"
   ```

3. **Styling**
   ```
   Prompt: "Style the todo app with:
   - Modern design
   - Dark mode support
   - Smooth transitions
   - Responsive layout"
   ```

4. **JavaScript Logic**
   ```
   Prompt: "Implement todo functionality with:
   - Class-based architecture
   - Local storage persistence
   - Event handling
   - State management"
   ```

## Next Steps

Try extending the application using AI assistance:

1. Add due dates to todos
2. Implement categories/tags
3. Add priority levels
4. Create a search function
5. Add drag-and-drop reordering

## Tips for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Break Down Tasks**
   - Split complex features into smaller parts
   - Ask AI for specific implementations
   - Iterate on solutions

2. **Request Explanations**
   - Ask AI to explain complex patterns
   - Understand the reasoning behind choices
   - Learn from the implementations

3. **Iterate and Improve**
   - Start with basic features
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Use AI for optimization suggestions
